            <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus, often called the "Banker to the Poor," is a visionary Bangladeshi economist and social entrepreneur. He is renowned for founding Grameen Bank in 1983, pioneering the concept of microfinance and microcredit, which provide small loans to impoverished individuals, particularly women, to start businesses and escape poverty. His innovative approach revolutionized global poverty alleviation strategies, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Beyond microfinance, Dr. Yunus advocates for social business, a model prioritizing societal benefits over profit. His unwavering dedication to economic empowerment and social innovation has inspired millions, making him a global icon of transformative change.</p>
